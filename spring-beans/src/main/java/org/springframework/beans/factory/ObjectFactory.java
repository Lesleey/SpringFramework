/**
 * Defines a factory which can return an Object instance
 * (possibly shared or independent) when invoked.
 *
 * <p>This interface is typically used to encapsulate a generic factory which
 * returns a new instance (prototype) of some target object on each invocation.
 *
 * <p>This interface is similar to {@link FactoryBean}, but implementations
 * of the latter are normally meant to be defined as SPI instances in a
 * {@link BeanFactory}, while implementations of this class are normally meant
 * to be fed as an API to other beans (through injection). As such, the
 * {@code getObject()} method has different exception handling behavior.

 *
 *   使用该接口通常每次调用都会返回一个新的实例（使用方式通常将该类注入到其他 bean中），而 {@link FactoryBean} 的实现类是被定义作为一个 SPI实例
 *  生命周期不同的 bean之间相互引用的问题，可以在连接点使用该类引用与自己生命周期不同的bean， 在每次使用目标bean 时通过该类进行检索，不需要直接依赖于目标 bean
